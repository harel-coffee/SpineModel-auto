    "- A) Francis Crick seminal paper on spines as locus for learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Morphology: how fixatives affect dimensions when you compare it with live conditions (A).\n",
    "- I thought about the asymmetry in diffusion for the spine neck. You said it was mostly due to volume, but how it depends on the diffusion coupling of the neck.\n",
    "- High resistance glutamate uncaging from Araya et al (Yuste), there was something odd in the interpretation.\n",
    "- A) Ruby-GABA is not clean, it may influence glu synapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "# TECHNIQUE STRATEGY\n",
    "- Does the procedure with DAB affect anything in the cell or tissue? (Apart from the landmarks)\n",
    "- What made labeling so hard?\n",
    "- C) explanation of 'plans' fig1c (I don't know what I meant here, nor what Christian said)\n",
    "- fig1c1 was not clear what it was for me.\n",

    "- A) Drawing of spine foot problematic\n",
    "- A/C) Color of the dendrite could be better is some other color  than brown is used \n",
    "- C) fig2d not clear pre and post synaptic compartments, neither PSDs. (Maybe drawing some region of interest?)\n",
    "- C) fig2d does not seem to provide new info from fig2c\n",
    "- fig2f how many other reconstructions are there of axons.\n",
    "-C) Are parameters for oblate/prolate somehow fine-tuned to produce that gap? Is the ratio L/D the best thing to plot? Does this provide any new info?\n",
    "- A) There is no bias/ no stat diff for DiS compared to SiS?\n",
    "- A) Fig3e How does 9% of DiS fit with data from others?\n",
    "- What are the error bars of 9%?\n",
    "- Does fig3f provide any new information? (not clear, not even clear why I wrote this either :) )\n",
    "- fig3 H and I switch places\n",

    "# SA\n",
    "- fig3 k : yellow is hard to see (but better than previous one)\n",
    "- A) fig 3 m2 change resistance to diffusion coupling or something else\n",
    "- where does SA due to size go?\n",
    "- A) Spine SA+ ----> spine + SA?\n",
    "- A) It will be difficult to write this thing of SA and size\n",
    "- S) Any way to normalize by size somehow?\n",
    "- C) Variability: is there a way to get the most \"relevant\" parameters?\n",
    "      - PCA -clustering algorithms -etc\n",

    "- A) Leak resistance compare order of magnitude spine head to SA block thing.\n",
    "- A) We have to be more careful with intracellular Calcium\n",
    "-  You said something about Calcium which was not completely right - Ca current vs intracellular free Ca\n",
    "- A) axo-spinal to axo-spinus\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fig 5\n",
    "- C) Sketch - if 2 spines one with the shape of DiS and the other SiS.\n",
    "- A) profile of interneurons spiking: FS vs RS for SST+ int?\n",

    "# Final comments\n",
    "C)\n",
    " - The story should come together more nicely? Better glue needed\n",
    " - Why do we had to work together?\n",
    " - Is there a particular variable that has a big meaning?\n",
    " - Can you identify things that are absent from the dataset?\n",
    " - What are the parameters can be useful for others\n",
    " - Include differences between DiS and SiS when presenting the model? What is characteristic of DiS? Not only inhibition, excitation too. Its size. Its effect in the soma. Anything."
